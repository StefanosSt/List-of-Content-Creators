# Contributing Guidelines

- Add single resource in one pull request as it will allow for easier review.
- Write your resource just by writing in the README.md file.

- Pull request title should include Category Name and the Name or Channel of creator.
  - Example: `Web/App Development -> TechWithTim`

- Feel free to add a new category if you think it's needed on the pull request

**PS**: If you like that, throw me a *Star*
